# Keras Core is becoming Keras 3 and has moved to keras-team/keras

Multi-backend Keras has a new repo: [keras-team/keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras).
Open any issues / PRs there. `keras-team/keras-core` is no longer in use.

**Keras Core** was the codename of the multi-backend Keras project throughout its initial development
(April 2023 - July 2023) and its public beta test (July 2023 - September 2023). Now, Keras Core
is gearing up to become Keras 3, to be released under the `keras` name. As such, we've moved development
back to [keras-team/keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras).

Meanwhile, the legacy `tf.keras` codebase is now available at
[keras-team/tf-keras](https://github.com/keras-team/tf-keras).

If you were a contributor to Keras Core -- thank you! Your commits have been reapplied in
`keras-team/keras` under your own authorship, so that your contribution record is fully preserved.

Likewise, if you were a contributor to `keras-team/keras` before the swap, your contribution
history has been fully preserved: the new commits have been reapplied on top of the old git tree.
